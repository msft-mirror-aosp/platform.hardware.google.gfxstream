=== Description

Implementations may be able to support an extended address space for sparse
memory resources, but only for a certain set of usages.

This extension adds a query for the extended limit, and the supported usages
that are allowed for that limit.
This limit is an increase to
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::pname:sparseAddressSpaceSize when the
slink:VkImage or slink:VkBuffer uses only usages that are supported.
